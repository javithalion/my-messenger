# my-messenger

This is the root repo that contains links to the entire __my-mesenger__ system. This is a project to practice some concepts that I'm not allowed to use in my daily basis projects.

## Goal
System where you can log in, register recipients (whatsapp, email...) and schedule messages to be sent on a specific date and time to a list of recipients.

## Documentation
Overall system documentation can be found in this repository under the __docs__ folder. Specific component's documentation can be found on its own repo. You can find the repo links below.
